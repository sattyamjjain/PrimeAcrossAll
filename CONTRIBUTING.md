## How to Contribute

1. **Fork the repository**: Start by forking the project repository to your GitHub account.
2. **Clone your fork**: Clone the repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sattyamjjain/PrimeAcrossAll.git
   ```

3. **Create a new branch**: Create a new branch for your contribution.

   ```bash
   git checkout -b my-new-feature
   ```

4. **Make your changes**: Implement your feature or fix, ensuring it follows the projectâ€™s coding guidelines.
5. **Run tests**: Before submitting, ensure your changes pass all the relevant tests (if applicable).
6. **Commit your changes**: Make sure to provide a clear and concise commit message.

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add support for XYZ language"
   ```

7. **Push your branch**: Push the branch with your changes to GitHub.

   ```bash
   git push origin my-new-feature
   ```

8. **Open a Pull Request**: Once your branch is pushed, open a Pull Request (PR) to the `main` branch of the main repository.

## Pull Request Guidelines

- **One feature per Pull Request**: Please keep PRs focused on a single feature or fix. If you have multiple features, submit them as separate PRs.
- **Keep changes minimal**: Avoid large refactors or formatting changes unless necessary.
- **Write descriptive commit messages**: Each commit message should explain what and why you changed something.

## Coding Guidelines

Please ensure that your code follows these general coding guidelines:

1. **Consistency**: Follow the patterns and conventions used in the existing code.
2. **Language-Specific Conventions**: Adhere to language-specific best practices (e.g., PEP8 for Python, PSR-2 for PHP).
3. **Comments**: Comment your code where necessary to explain complex logic.
4. **File Names**: Ensure file names match the convention used in each language (e.g., `prime.py`, `prime.c`).
5. **README**: Update the relevant `README.md` in the language directory if your contribution requires special instructions.

## Common Issues

### Issue: My code works locally but fails on another machine

- Make sure you're using the correct version of the programming language.
