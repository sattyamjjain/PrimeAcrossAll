# C Prime Number Checker

This C program checks if a given number is prime. The logic is optimized by checking divisibility only up to the square root of the number.

## How to Compile and Run

1. Make sure you have a C compiler installed (e.g., GCC).
2. Navigate to the `c/` directory.
3. Compile the program:
    `gcc prime.c -o prime`
4. Run the compiled program:
    `./prime`
5. Input a number to check if it's prime.

## Example

Enter a number to check if it's prime: 17 17 is a prime number.
