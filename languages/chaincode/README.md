# Chaincode Prime Number Checker

This is a prime number checker implemented as a Hyperledger Fabric chaincode using Go.

## How to Run

Since this is a chaincode implementation, it must be deployed in a Hyperledger Fabric network.

For a local simulation or test:

```bash
go run languages/chaincode/prime.go
