# Cirq Prime Number Check

This implementation checks whether a number is prime using Cirq, a framework for quantum circuits in Python. However, the prime-checking algorithm itself is classical (implemented in Python).

## Run

To run the prime check for Cirq:

```bash
python3 languages/cirq/prime.py
