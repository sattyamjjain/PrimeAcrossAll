# JavaScript Prime Number Checker

This JavaScript program checks whether a given number is prime. The logic is optimized by checking divisibility only up to the square root of the number.

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system (or you can run it in a browser).
2. Navigate to the `javascript/` directory.
3. Run the script with Node.js:
    `node prime.js`
4. Input a number to check if it's prime.

## Example

Enter a number to check if it's prime: 17 17 is a prime number.
