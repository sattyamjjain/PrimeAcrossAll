# Kotlin Prime Number Checker

This Kotlin program checks if a given number is prime. The logic is optimized by checking divisibility only up to the square root of the number.

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Kotlin installed.
2. Navigate to the `kotlin/` directory.
3. Compile the program:
   `kotlinc Prime.kt -include-runtime -d Prime.jar`
4. Run the compiled jar:
    `java -jar Prime.jar`
5. Input a number to check if it's prime.

## Example

Enter a number to check if it's prime: 17
17 is a prime number.
