# Perl Prime Number Checker

This Perl script checks whether a given number is prime. The logic is optimized by checking divisibility only up to the square root of the number.

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Perl installed.
2. Navigate to the `perl/` directory.
3. Run the script:
   `perl prime.pl`
4. Input a number to check if it's prime.

## Example

Enter a number to check if it's prime: 17
17 is a prime number.
