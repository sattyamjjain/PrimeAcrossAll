# Qiskit Prime Number Checker

This implementation checks if a number is prime using a classical algorithm in Python. Qiskit is installed, though this particular algorithm doesn't require quantum computation.

## Usage

To check if a number is prime, run the script using Python with Qiskit installed:

```bash
python3 prime.py
